By nature they can easily scale tree limbs, clinging vines or along overhead wires and utility lines. Like all rats and mice their front teeth are constantly growing so they need to gnaw to keep them worn down. They will readily chew wood siding, concrete, insulation or electrical wires &#8211; though they will eat almost anything and aren\u2019t always up high; sometimes in rockeries, crawl spaces or wood piles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"norway-rat\">Norway Rat or Sewer Rat<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Roof rat, the bigger Norway rat likes to burrow in the ground, sewers (also called Sewer rats), cellars or garbage areas. They are excellent swimmers, nocturnal and often in groups. They eat a lot and drink lots of water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"583\" height=\"485\" src=\"http:\/\/wp4.test418.dreamersi.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/rat-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Roof Rat vs Norway Rat diagram\" class=\"wp-image-295\" srcset=\"https:\/\/paratex.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/rat-diagram.jpg 583w, https:\/\/paratex.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/rat-diagram-250x208.jpg 250w, https:\/\/paratex.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/rat-diagram-120x100.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mice\">Mice<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mice can squeeze through an opening as small as \u00bc inch and, while smaller than rats, they are found in groups, breed quickly and have several litters a year. They also gnaw on most anything and contaminate food meant for humans or pets.
